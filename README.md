## Key Findings

### Market Landscape

- **233 companies** researched in total
- ~55 are clearly SMB-oriented AI/automation agencies
- Most common entry points: free consultation (~62 companies), AI audit/readiness assessment (~55), retainer/support (~79)
- Low/no-code stack (n8n, Make, Zapier, HubSpot) appears in ~65 companies

### What's Overrated

- AI strategy consulting as a standalone first offer
- "Custom AI agents" as a vague umbrella positioning
- Broad "AI transformation" messaging for SMBs
- Free AI audits without clear implementation path

### What Actually Sells to SMBs

- Lead response and follow-up automation (strongest ROI story)
- Customer support / AI receptionist (clear pain, easy demo)
- Internal ops automation sprints (saved hours, easy to scope)
- Fixed-fee implementations with monthly optimization retainers

### Offer Category Scoring (SMB Fit)

| Offer | Ease of Sale | Speed to Result | ROI Clarity | Crowdedness |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lead Response System | Very High | Very High | Very High | High but manageable |
| Support AI / Receptionist | High | High | High | High |
| Internal Ops Sprint | High | High | High | Medium |
| Document / Knowledge | Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| AI Audit | Medium | Low | Low | Very High |
| Custom AI Agents | Low | Low | Low | High |
| AI Strategy Consulting | Low | Very Low | Very Low | Very High |

## Research Methodology

Each company goes through a 5-round pipeline:

1. **4 parallel Google searches** — services, LinkedIn, reviews, founder/funding
2. **4 parallel website fetches** — /services, /about, /pricing, /case-studies
3. **4 gap-filling searches** — pricing rates, social presence, client verification, financials
4. **Homepage funnel analysis** — every CTA, form, booking system, lead magnet
5. **Cross-reference & red flags** — website claims vs. LinkedIn headcount, client verification

### Hard Rules

- **Never trust /blog/ pages** — blogs are SEO marketing, not operational truth
- **Claimed vs. Verified** — every data point is tagged with its source type
- **"Not found" over guessing** — no inferred data presented as fact
- **Public sources only** — no paid databases (Apollo, ZoomInfo, Semrush, etc.)
